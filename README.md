A baby game for Android

Have a baby curious about shiny tablets and phones? Use this app as a baby-game and, more importantly, to prevent random taps of a baby from doing anything you may not want.

This app will show a small piano a baby can use to explore sounds in a mobile device. At the same time, it will block any naive attempts at closing the app. The back, home and apps-menu buttons will be blocked, and Android's top menu won't be available.

This ensures a baby can't accidentally close the game, preventing any actions on the device you may not want.

Grown ups can unlock the app by touching the settings icon with one finger, then holding the second setting icon with another finger.

**Currently looking for help!**

Contributions to design & sound packs would be especially welcome. (Can anyone recommend sound packs with an open source license?) The project only has piano sounds and I'd love some more variety. Also, it's ugly as hell. I'd love to make it a bit nicer but my design skills are limited to command line interfaces. Contributions will be appreciated!
